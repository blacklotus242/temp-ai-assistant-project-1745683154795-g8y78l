# 📝 Bolt Handoff Summary

## 🔥 Overview

This handoff includes two connected projects designed to work with a shared server backend for a Voice- and Glasses-enabled AI Assistant Platform.

| Project | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Web Dashboard (Desktop App) | React + Vite app for AI Assistant functions, integrations (Asana, Google Calendar, Genius Scan, MileIQ). |
| Mobile Bridge App (Phone App) | React Native (Expo) app for capturing images and sending voice commands directly to the server, acting as a bridge for AI Glasses. |

## 🧠 Key Architecture

## 📂 Project Repositories Structure

- final_ocr_gpt_glass_project_glasses_ready.zip → Web Dashboard (Desktop).
- mobile_bridge_app_ready.zip → Mobile Bridge App (React Native).

✅ Keep them separate but link them by using the same API endpoint environment config.

## ⚙️ Bolt Tasks Overview

| Project | Immediate Actions |
|:---|:---|
| Web Dashboard | Finalize OAuth integrations, polish UI, add authentication layer if needed. |
| Mobile Bridge App | Add user login (optional), finalize server URL config, polish Camera and Command screen UI. |
| Server | Set up proper security, token validation, and real-time event pushing (future). |

## 🎯 Final Goal

- User can interact through Desktop or Mobile.
- Mobile/Glasses commands sync to Asana + Google Calendar.
- Genius Scan and MileIQ integrations feed directly into the assistant system.
- Future: TTS replies, Smart Glasses full support, Trip logging automation.
